It allows to transform `UITextField` as `UIPickerView` and `UIDatePicker` to pick data easily. It is designed to present a picker view to select data in `UITextField`.

#Getting Started
----------

<div id='section-id-90'/>

##Create instance of AAPickerView

You just need to assign `AAPickerView` class to your `UITextField` and make the outlet:
```swift
@IBOutlet weak var picker: AAPickerView!
```

Now your `UITextField` is transformed as a picker view as `AAPickerView`.


<div id='section-id-104'/>

##Define picker type

Define type of picker you want to use in your text field. There are two types of pickers available in `AAPickerView` that are:

- `StringPicker` for `UIPickerView`
- `DatePicker` for `UIDatePicker`

Assign one of them as follow:

```swift
picker1.pickerType = .StringPicker
picker2.pickerType = .DatePicker
```

<div id='section-id-112'/>

##Customise the toolbar

You can change `UIToolbar` colours like:
```swift
picker.toolbar.barTintColor = .darkGray
picker.toolbar.tintColor = .black
```

<div id='section-id-132'/>

##Customise StringPicker Label

You can get and customise the `StringPicker` label as `UILabel`:
```swift
let label = picker.pickerRow
label.font = UIFont(name: "American Typewriter", size: 30)
```

<div id='section-id-150'/>

##Customise UIDatePicker & DateFormatter

You can get your `UIDatePicker` and `DateFormatter` which is using behind your `UITextField` as:
```swift
let datePicker = picker.datePicker
datePicker?.datePickerMode = .date

let dateFormatter = picker.dateFormatter
dateFormatter.dateFormat = "dd/MM/YYYY" 
```


<div id='section-id-151'/>

##Listen changes thorough callbacks

You can listen the changes of data simply by using the following callback methods:

- StringPicker:
```swift
picker.stringDidChange = { index in
print("selectedString ", self.stringData[index])
}
```

- DatePicker
```swift
picker.dateDidChange = { date in
print("selectedDate ", date )
}
```
